Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
This principle states two essential things:

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on abstractions.
This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with .NET/.NET Core framework, you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up. It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because it makes your code hard to refactor.

Bad:

public abstract class EmployeeBase
{
    protected virtual void Work()
    {
        // ....working
    }
}

public class Human : EmployeeBase
{
    public override void Work()
    {
        //.... working much more
    }
}

public class Robot : EmployeeBase
{
    public override void Work()
    {
        //.... working much, much more
    }
}

public class Manager
{
    private readonly Robot _robot;
    private readonly Human _human;

    public Manager(Robot robot, Human human)
    {
        _robot = robot;
        _human = human;
    }

    public void Manage()
    {
        _robot.Work();
        _human.Work();
    }
}


<MY NOTE>

The good sample here not are much better to explain. I use this sample with Manga DDD application on mind.
Then I use namespaces to facilitate. Use ApplicationLayer and InfrastructureLayer thats represent project apart.
Application define interface. Infrastructure realize this interface. Application create a new instance and invoke interface method.
In this way high-level modules (Application) don´t depend on low-level module (Infraestructure). Only abstraction (interface).
Abastractions (interface) should not depend upon details (what work method perform). Details should depend on abstractions.
